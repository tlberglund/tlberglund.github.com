    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wandered lonely as a cloud app<br/>
Late of Heroku purchases<br/>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br/>
A host of microservices<br/>
Beyond the build, beneath the stats<br/>
My code in chunks and bits thereat</p>

<p>Continuous was the app deployed<br/>
In all its many-splendored parts<br/>
They spread in Dockerfiles alloyed<br/>
With CoreOS hosts' very hearts<br/>
Ten thousand saw I when I looked<br/>
At Kubernetes’ dashboard hooks</p>

<p>The Mesos cluster’s web display<br/>
Showed every resource fully used<br/>
Yet the goal at start of day<br/>
Was just an app for scraping news<br/>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br/>
That wealth to me this stack had brought</p>

<p>Now oft, when at my screen I stare,<br/>
Commenting on Hacker News,<br/>
My only company, despair<br/>
And the bill from EC2,<br/>
Then filled my heart with sorrow is—<br/>
The sorrow of the services.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://blog.circleci.com/its-the-future/">Paul Biggar’s fictional dialog</a> on the same topic. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Wandered_Lonely_as_a_Cloud">the Wordsworth original</a> of which I frankly am not too fond, but for which I am grateful on the occasion of my own fooling about.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: since I have friends who work with some of the named technologies, I should make it clear that I am not down on any of them. As I have <a href="https://player.oreilly.com/videos/9781491924914">said elsewhere</a> (shameless plug!), distributed systems are bad in just about every way and should be avoided when possible. Fortunately—since I make my living in distributed systems—sometimes they are the only way to do the awesome thing you want to do.</p>
