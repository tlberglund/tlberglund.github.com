    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Suddenly everybody is working from home and on video calls <em>all the time</em>. This has been my life for years (when I'm not on the road, that is), and because I'm also a video hobbyist, it might not come as a total surprise that I have slightly overdone my home office video seutp. I get questions about it from time to time, so I figured I'd finally put together the video I've been threatening to do for years.</p>

<p>And hey, how timely! We're all working from home in the past month, with no clear idea for how much longer that will last. And because people at work often ask me about my setup, I figured I'd put together some tips for how to do video calls from home. It's all in the video, but I suggest three phases of home office video setup development:</p>

<ol>
<li>Just use your laptop webcam, but face a window</li>
<li>Get a ring light or a softbox</li>
<li>Go completely insane</li>
</ol>


<p><iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yhzzfg1TH9E " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>In the video, I promised a link to actual things you could order (as of the time of this writing), which I've given below. You might notice the jump between the cost of phase two and phase three is a lot of money, and, well, you're right. There are varioius reasons why the middle ground is sparse here, and I may address them in a subsequent video. Just know that I'm not purposely overlooking a sensible middle ground. Video is funny this way.</p>

<h2>PHASE ONE</h2>

<ul>
<li>No purchase necessary—if you have windows and can work near them</li>
</ul>


<h2>PHASE TWO</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1490918-REG/gvm_gvm_hd_18s_gvm_hd_18s_55w_bc.html">Ring light</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Professional-Photography-Centimeters-Lighting/dp/B017D7W57S">Low-cost softbox kit</a></li>
<li>A better webcam? Honestly probably not.</li>
</ul>


<h2>PHASE THREE (do not attempt)</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Professional-Photography-Centimeters-Lighting/dp/B017D7W57S">Low-cost softbox kit</a> (if you didn't buy it in phase two)</li>

    <updated>2016-06-03T08:56:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://tlberglund.github.com/blog/2016/06/03/the-rime-of-the-product-manager</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After I wrote <a href="http://timberglund.com/blog/2012/08/03/the-maven/"><em>The Maven</em></a>, I started thinking about what poem I would hack next. I didn't intend to land on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge">another Romantic</a>--allegedly I do not even like the Romantics very much--but then the title just came to me one day. I want to say "and then the rest happened quickly," but in fact principal photography took place over a total of four days spread over more than two years. Editing and the <a href="https://zachberglund.com">the composer's</a> work came together quite a bit more quickly than that, and only at that point could the rest be declared to be history.</p>

<p>My plan for <em>Rime</em> was to produce a more complex film with multiple sets and multiple actors. This is a difficult undertaking for professionals, much less unschooled hacks who are trying to produce the least amateurish artifact they possibly can. I can say two things about the process: it is apparently difficult to get right, and it is one of the most enjoyable things I do.</p>

<p>With that, I present to you <em>The Rime of the Product Manager</em>:</p>

<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/168461051" width="600" height="338" class="center" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

<p>I won't drag you through a detailed account of what I meant to convey with the film, but I will say that my message changed from the time I originally hatched the idea to the time I finished editing. The place I landed is hopefully obvious enough. Once again, because artistic license sometimes pulls me to extremes, I should make it clear that it is not my opinion that the role of the product manager (or "product owner," which is more precise but does not scan) is a bad thing, nor on the other hand do I think Scrum is somehow destructive.</p>

<p>Finally, you might just consider giving the original poem, <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43997">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>, a read. You can also clone and build the <a href="https://github.com/tlberglund/rotpm">Asciidoc-based screenplay</a>, or just read the full text here:</p>

<h2><em>The Rime of the Product Manager</em></h2>

<p>```
A tired Product Manager
Spies a group of friends
He grabs the young one and proceeds
His great wisdom to lend</p>

<p>The Conference-Goer stands chagrinned
His eyes and mouth agape
The PM grabs his hand and then
His friends make their escape</p>

<p>The Conference-Goer took his seat:
He cannot choose but hear;
And so spoke on that tired man,
The Product Manager.</p>

<p>We started in a coffee shop
Upon a city street
UI mocks were drink to us
And code our only meat</p>

<p>We coded long, we coded hard
We coded day and night
We coded like our days would end
Unless we code aright</p>

<p>None among us told his peer
The features he should build
If we'd have played the manager
Our vision we'd have killed</p>

<p>Then one dark night, we launched the site
Our hearts besot with hope
In Graphite's thrall we watched it all
And dread caught every throat</p>

<p>We watched the charts all day and night
Frowning, sighing gently
Our only goal, the favor of
The Valley Cognoscienti</p>

<p>We got the mentions we were after
Traffic started spiking
The cluster groaned under the load
All servers running to the hilt
We dared to think we might have built
A product of our liking</p>

<p>We bathed in growing revenue
With metrics in our favor
Subscribers new, renewals too
Made these the days to savor</p>

<p>The VCs saw what we had built
And offered to us terms
That we could scarcely not accept
—so much we had to learn!</p>

<p>We closed an A round and we thought
Success was now in hand!
Who could but think that capital
Had ratified our plans?</p>

<p>With all due youthful confidence
We set ourselves to hiring
We poached, cajoled, and outbid for
The staff of our desiring</p>

<p>And what with shiny laptops humming
Could all these hackers do?
They built the features users wanted
Feature on feature accrued</p>

<p>We coded long, we coded hard
But a hacker needs to rest!
With VC funds we bought some cheer
And wine and gin and Scotch and beer
We worked and drank and worked 'til near
Our work was not our best</p>

<p>Now such a team could scarce avoid
A Providential chastening
No one could know that this new flow
Had been our failure hastening</p>

<p>Those early days of coding hard
In cafes on the cheap?
Were gone and in their place we’d built
A comp’ny growing weak</p>

<p>No longer was each eager coder
Focused on our users
No vision animated them
No judgment was within their ken
We looked at our new features then
We judged these features losers</p>

<p>We all agreed the thing we’d need
Without a doubt averred:
I’d hang up coding and become
A Product Manager</p>

<p>The founders’ product vision now
Came through the medium
Of story cards and backlogged scars
Of endless tedium</p>

<p>And I had done a hellish thing,
And it would work 'em woe:
For all had seen, I'd killed the team
That made the comp’ny grow.
You wretch! said they, the team to slay,
That made the comp’ny grow!</p>

<p>Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, no more did we code;
As idle as a painted team
Upon a painted repo</p>

<p>Product, product everywhere
And happiness did shrink
Product, product everywhere
Nor anyone to think</p>

<p>Subscription growth had flatlined and
Our runway shrank to nothing
Subscriber acquisition cost
So bloated we were blushing</p>

<p>That dream team that we'd hired then?
No longer could they trust
We'd have an exit worth their time
So left they as they must</p>

<p>If it were only staff I lost
Survive I just have might
Buy my partner joined the tide
And left me in my plight</p>

<p>There was nothing left to build
The vision we had started
I could only turn and leave
A founder, broken-hearted</p>

<p>And now I fly from show to show
Spreading far my story
To coders young who've yet to learn
What made my heart so hoary</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what your scale
Nor where you got your funding
If devs don't love their users then
Your futures will be plunging</p>

<p>The vision that you started with
To set the world aright?
Must be spread to everyone
Who gives your product life</p>

<p>The sub-creators of the world
Must love the things they make
If you would lead, then you're the one
To spark their hearts awake</p>

<p>They can't be bought with snacks or drink
And process least of all
Can bring the flush of health into
A coder once he fall</p>

<p>And now I fly from show to show
Telling wide my story
To coders young who may yet learn
Where lies their future glory</p>

<p>The old PM, whose eye is bright,
Whose blog with age is stale,
Is gone; and now the Conference-Goer
Departs the conference vale.</p>

<p>He leaves like one who has been stunned,
And is of sense forlorn:
A sadder, wiser hacker then
He rose the morrow morn.
```</p>

    <updated>2012-08-03T08:51:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://tlberglund.github.com/blog/2012/08/03/the-maven</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After I wrote <a href="http://www.augusttechgroup.com/tim/blog/2011/05/12/oh-the-methods-youll-compose/">Oh, The Methods You'll Compose</a> last year, I started casting about for what I'd do next.  I had just finished writing <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920019909.do">Building and Testing With Gradle</a> with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewatambientideas">Matthew</a>, so JVM build tools were on my mind (and in the case of <a href="http://gradle.org">Gradle</a>, they still are). Standing in my kitchen one spring day, not thinking about anything in particular, it hit me that <em>Maven</em> rhymes with <em>Raven</em>. The rest is, of course, history.</p>

<p>A long and interesting history, as it turns out. One filled with glued-on muttonchops, an awesome sister who knows far too much about period costumes and has more 19th-century-looking artifacts lying around her house than ought to be allowed, and a son who shows no small amount of promise as a composer. It is therefore with great pride that I present to you <em>The Maven</em>:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mBmExt184vc " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h2>Full Text of <em>The Maven</em></h2>

<p>```
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
Over files from a project which I'd never built before,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly the build was crapping,
As if some build script's code was jacking, jacking up my source code store
"'Tis a little bug," I muttered, "crapping on my source code store—
Only this, and nothing more."</p>

<p>Ah, distinctly I remember I was just a junior member,
Of a staff who counted building code as something to ignore
An open-source solution neatly I had sought to use completely
In vain hope that I deplete the problems in my source code store—
To fix the troubled build that kept a hold on my poor source code store—
My broken build, for evermore.</p>

<p>And the sullen sad surrender of my servers to the end of
Days when code would build had lent me terrors never felt before
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
"'Tis some little bug entreating entrance to my source code store—
Some little bug entreating entrance to my source code store—
Only this, and nothing more,"</p>

<p>Presently I took to guessing how my build script might be messing
Messing up the build I thought should work as in the days of yore
But the fact is I was coding, not counting on the foul foreboding
Of a Tool now overgrowing the bound'ries of its building chore
It made its mark upon my code beyond its humble building chore
It owned my build, still wanting more</p>

<p>Deep into the POM file peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no coder ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken (the error message gave no token),
And my greatest fear unspoken was if again I'd have control
Could I again believe myself to be the one who had control?
To own my build, and nothing more?</p>

<p>Back unto my laptop turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again the build was crapping somewhat harder than before.
"Surely," said I, "surely that is what happens when a depend'ncy graph is
Stretched until the length of path is b’yond what man has seen before
Let me see what jars are needed, and their dependencies explore—
'Tis just the jars and nothing more!</p>

<p>"Now adopted as our standard to build each project I commanded
Maven be the tool that we would use to ease our building chore
Straight away it took to forcing us to follow, not endorsing
Its coerc’d opinions now divorcing sense from all my source code store
It took control of every build inside my troubled source code store
I built with Maven, evermore</p>

<p>From the enterprise beguiling this tool my fancy into smiling,
By the standard settings and conventions rigid that it bore,
"Though thy brackets angled, Maven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven.
Mayhap you'd ease the maintenance of my builds and their Sis'phean chore
Tell me, can you ease the burden of my Sisyphean chore?"
Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."</p>

<p>Much I marveled this ungainly tool to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with speaking tools within his source code store—
Tool or script within the central repo of his source code store,
With such name as "Nevermore."</p>

<p>But the Maven chosen boldly as our standard now spoke only
That one word, as if its soul in that one word it did outpour.
No more meaning then it printed—though its output scrolled and dinted—
Till I scarcely more than hinted "Other builds I've built before;
On the morrow it will leave me, as my builds have failed before."
Then the tool said, "Nevermore."</p>

<p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
Written by a tortured coder whose melancholy's only token
Left both code and coder broken till his tool one burden bore—
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of 'Never-nevermore.'</p>

<p>"But the Maven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of build and editor;
Then, upon the vinyl sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous tool of yore—
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous tool of yore
Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</p>

<p>Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the tool whose fiery eyes now burned into my coder's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the Aeron's vinyl lining which the backlight gloated o'er,
But whose charcoal vinyl lining which the backlight gloated o'er,
My code shall see, ah, nevermore!</p>

<p>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by an unseen censer
And dependencies whose downloads glut my cache, and even more.
"Wretch!" I cried, "VanZyl hath lent you—by these downloads he has sent you
Respite, respite! and some Red Bull from my cursed source code store
Quaff, oh quaff this can of Red Bull, and forget this source code store!"
Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."</p>

<p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, build tool or devil!
Whether useful tool, or whether bane of every coder on this floor
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this code base yet enchanted—
On this build by horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
Is there a tool that would not own me? Tell me, tell me, I implore!"
Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."</p>

<p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! Prophet still, build tool or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, by building with the Maven,
Shall I never make the claim that I retain just some control?
Could some little token of my build remain in my control?"
Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."</p>

<p>"Be that word our sign of parting, building fiend!" I shrieked upstarting—
"Get thee back to Sonatype deep in the night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no jar file as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my project's build unbroken!—quit my central source code store!
Take thy POM from out my heart, and take thy cache from my code store!
"Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."</p>

<p>And the Maven, never quitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
In that pallid project's repo deep inside my source code store;
Its POM files' eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the backlight o'er me streaming throws my shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted—nevermore!
```</p>

<p>Now would probably be a good time to re-read the full text of <a href="http://poestories.com/read/raven">the original work</a>. It's truly a brilliant poem, without which this remix would not have been possible.</p>
