  <div class="entry-content"><p>Suddenly everybody is working from home and on video calls <em>all the time</em>. This has been my life for years (when I&#8217;m not on the road, that is), and because I&#8217;m also a video hobbyist, it might not come as a total surprise that I have slightly overdone my home office video seutp. I get questions about it from time to time, so I figured I&#8217;d finally put together the video I&#8217;ve been threatening to do for years.</p>

<p>And hey, how timely! We&#8217;re all working from home in the past month, with no clear idea for how much longer that will last. And because people at work often ask me about my setup, I figured I&#8217;d put together some tips for how to do video calls from home. It&#8217;s all in the video, but I suggest three phases of home office video setup development:</p>

<ol>
<li>Just use your laptop webcam, but face a window</li>
<li>Get a ring light or a softbox</li>
<li>Go completely insane</li>
</ol>

<p>In the video, I promised a link to actual things you could order (as of the time of this writing), which I&#8217;ve given below. You might notice the jump between the cost of phase two and phase three is a lot of money, and, well, you&#8217;re right. There are varioius reasons why the middle ground is sparse here, and I may address them in a subsequent video. Just know that I&#8217;m not purposely overlooking a sensible middle ground. Video is funny this way.</p>

<h2>PHASE ONE</h2>

<ul>
<li>No purchase necessary—if you have windows and can work near them</li>
</ul>


<h2>PHASE TWO</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1490918-REG/gvm_gvm_hd_18s_gvm_hd_18s_55w_bc.html">Ring light</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Professional-Photography-Centimeters-Lighting/dp/B017D7W57S">Low-cost softbox kit</a></li>
<li>A better webcam? Honestly probably not.</li>
</ul>


<h2>PHASE THREE (do not attempt)</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Professional-Photography-Centimeters-Lighting/dp/B017D7W57S">Low-cost softbox kit</a> (if you didn&#8217;t buy it in phase two)</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past year I’ve developed a pretty crisp vision for what Developer Relations ought to be. Organizationally speaking, it’s a team that couples a technology company to the developers who consume its product. But it&#8217;s also a world-class training team. It’s technology evangelism. It’s focused, correct, accessible documentation. It’s community. It’s relevant, professional sample code. It’s next-level online learning. It’s anything a developer needs to be successful using a technology company’s products.</p>

<p>And more than that, it’s personality. There is no single technology a developer can adopt that does not have alternatives, and to win in the marketplace, functionality matters, performance matters, and easily accessible learning pathways matter. But most people don’t make choices based on the figure of merit their bakeoff spreadsheet calculated. People make choices based on what kind of people they aspire to be. It’s not enough for a DevRel team to deliver on community, evangelism, and education: DevRel must also project a personality. It must be collectively the kind of person developers themselves aspire, in one way or another, to be.</p>

<p>It’s a liberating thing to have some clarity about the professional mission you want to accomplish. Once I had the picture in my head and realized I was pretty well equipped to carry it out, I wanted to find a company that not only shared the vision, and was not just willing to execute on it, but was downright <em>eager</em> to. The executive team at Confluent convinced me that they were just such a team, and I suppose I convinced them that I was the guy to lead the effort. Starting today, I am Senior Director of Developer Experience for Confluent. We&#8217;re calling it &#8220;DevX&#8221; for short, for obvious reasons of coolness.</p>

<p>I’ve told my non-tech friends that, apart from the logo on the hoodie, they won’t notice any difference in the new job on a personal basis. I’ll still travel a lot, speak a lot, and run a team. I’m still working with vaguely computery things. Peeking under the hood a little bit, I’m moving from one data-related Apache project to another data-related (frequently complimentary) Apache project. I am in a real sense just getting fitted for a new hoodie—but of course there is so much more in the move than first meets the eye.</p>

<p>It should not go without saying that I realize what a gift it is even to be able to have this conversation with myself. Plenty of people in the developed world are just trying to make a buck, and aren’t thinking about how to craft a role that provides them with the greatest possible sense of autonomy, mastery, and purpose (thereby maximizing their intrinsic motivation) with the greatest organizational-vision alignment they can manage. And while the developing world is enjoying a tremendous boost in prosperity over the last two or three decades, most of its citizens are also not thinking about how they can best follow their passion—unless that passion is clean water and a minimal education for their children. All of this job satisfaction talk is tech industry Valley-Speak. Most of the factors that makes it possible are not choices in which I exercised any agency.</p>

<p>But still. I&#8217;m thrilled I get to do this work, and excited to get started doing it today with Confluent. There is much ground to cover, and the world is not standing still. <em>Let&#8217;s do this</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I wrote <a href="http://timberglund.com/blog/2012/08/03/the-maven/"><em>The Maven</em></a>, I started thinking about what poem I would hack next. I didn&#8217;t intend to land on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge">another Romantic</a>&#8211;allegedly I do not even like the Romantics very much&#8211;but then the title just came to me one day. I want to say &#8220;and then the rest happened quickly,&#8221; but in fact principal photography took place over a total of four days spread over more than two years. Editing and the <a href="https://zachberglund.com">the composer&#8217;s</a> work came together quite a bit more quickly than that, and only at that point could the rest be declared to be history.</p>

<p>My plan for <em>Rime</em> was to produce a more complex film with multiple sets and multiple actors. This is a difficult undertaking for professionals, much less unschooled hacks who are trying to produce the least amateurish artifact they possibly can. I can say two things about the process: it is apparently difficult to get right, and it is one of the most enjoyable things I do.</p>

<p>With that, I present to you <em>The Rime of the Product Manager</em>:</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/168461051" width="600" height="338" class="center" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>I won&#8217;t drag you through a detailed account of what I meant to convey with the film, but I will say that my message changed from the time I originally hatched the idea to the time I finished editing. The place I landed is hopefully obvious enough. Once again, because artistic license sometimes pulls me to extremes, I should make it clear that it is not my opinion that the role of the product manager (or &#8220;product owner,&#8221; which is more precise but does not scan) is a bad thing, nor on the other hand do I think Scrum is somehow destructive.</p>

<p>Finally, you might just consider giving the original poem, <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43997">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>, a read. You can also clone and build the <a href="https://github.com/tlberglund/rotpm">Asciidoc-based screenplay</a>, or just read the full text here:</p>

</span><span class='line'>The Conference-Goer stands chagrinned
</span><span class='line'>His eyes and mouth agape
</span><span class='line'>The PM grabs his hand and then
</span><span class='line'>His friends make their escape
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>The Conference-Goer took his seat:
</span><span class='line'>He cannot choose but hear;
</span><span class='line'>And so spoke on that tired man,
</span><span class='line'>The Product Manager.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>We started in a coffee shop
</span><span class='line'>Upon a city street
</span><span class='line'>UI mocks were drink to us
</span><span class='line'>And code our only meat
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>We coded long, we coded hard
</span><span class='line'>We coded day and night
</span><span class='line'>We coded like our days would end
</span><span class='line'>Unless we code aright
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>None among us told his peer
</span><span class='line'>The features he should build
</span><span class='line'>If we'd have played the manager
</span><span class='line'>Our vision we'd have killed
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Then one dark night, we launched the site
</span><span class='line'>Our hearts besot with hope
</span><span class='line'>In Graphite's thrall we watched it all
</span><span class='line'>And dread caught every throat
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>We watched the charts all day and night
</span><span class='line'>Frowning, sighing gently
</span><span class='line'>Our only goal, the favor of
</span><span class='line'>The Valley Cognoscienti
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>We got the mentions we were after
</span><span class='line'>Traffic started spiking
</span><span class='line'>The cluster groaned under the load
</span><span class='line'>All servers running to the hilt
</span><span class='line'>We dared to think we might have built
</span><span class='line'>A product of our liking
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>We bathed in growing revenue
</span><span class='line'>With metrics in our favor
</span><span class='line'>Subscribers new, renewals too
</span><span class='line'>Made these the days to savor
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>The VCs saw what we had built
</span><span class='line'>And offered to us terms
</span><span class='line'>That we could scarcely not accept
</span><span class='line'>—so much we had to learn!
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>We closed an A round and we thought
</span><span class='line'>Success was now in hand!
</span><span class='line'>Who could but think that capital
</span><span class='line'>Had ratified our plans?
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>With all due youthful confidence
</span><span class='line'>We set ourselves to hiring
</span><span class='line'>We poached, cajoled, and outbid for
</span><span class='line'>The staff of our desiring
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>And what with shiny laptops humming
</span><span class='line'>Could all these hackers do?
</span><span class='line'>They built the features users wanted
</span><span class='line'>Feature on feature accrued
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>We coded long, we coded hard
</span><span class='line'>But a hacker needs to rest!
</span><span class='line'>With VC funds we bought some cheer
</span><span class='line'>And wine and gin and Scotch and beer
</span><span class='line'>We worked and drank and worked 'til near
</span><span class='line'>Our work was not our best
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Now such a team could scarce avoid
</span><span class='line'>A Providential chastening
</span><span class='line'>No one could know that this new flow
</span><span class='line'>Had been our failure hastening
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Those early days of coding hard
</span><span class='line'>In cafes on the cheap?
</span><span class='line'>Were gone and in their place we’d built
</span><span class='line'>A comp’ny growing weak
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>No longer was each eager coder
</span><span class='line'>Focused on our users
</span><span class='line'>No vision animated them
</span><span class='line'>No judgment was within their ken
</span><span class='line'>We looked at our new features then
</span><span class='line'>We judged these features losers
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>We all agreed the thing we’d need
</span><span class='line'>Without a doubt averred:
</span><span class='line'>I’d hang up coding and become
</span><span class='line'>A Product Manager
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>The founders’ product vision now
</span><span class='line'>Came through the medium
</span><span class='line'>Of story cards and backlogged scars
</span><span class='line'>Of endless tedium
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>And I had done a hellish thing,
</span><span class='line'>And it would work 'em woe:
</span><span class='line'>For all had seen, I'd killed the team
</span><span class='line'>That made the comp’ny grow.
</span><span class='line'>You wretch! said they, the team to slay,
</span><span class='line'>That made the comp’ny grow!
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Day after day, day after day,
</span><span class='line'>We stuck, no more did we code;
</span><span class='line'>As idle as a painted team
</span><span class='line'>Upon a painted repo
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Product, product everywhere
</span><span class='line'>And happiness did shrink
</span><span class='line'>Product, product everywhere
</span><span class='line'>Nor anyone to think
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Subscription growth had flatlined and
</span><span class='line'>Our runway shrank to nothing
</span><span class='line'>Subscriber acquisition cost
</span><span class='line'>So bloated we were blushing
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>That dream team that we'd hired then?
</span><span class='line'>No longer could they trust
</span><span class='line'>We'd have an exit worth their time
</span><span class='line'>So left they as they must
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>If it were only staff I lost
</span><span class='line'>Survive I just have might
</span><span class='line'>Buy my partner joined the tide
</span><span class='line'>And left me in my plight
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>There was nothing left to build
</span><span class='line'>The vision we had started
</span><span class='line'>I could only turn and leave
</span><span class='line'>A founder, broken-hearted
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>And now I fly from show to show
</span><span class='line'>Spreading far my story
</span><span class='line'>To coders young who've yet to learn
</span><span class='line'>What made my heart so hoary
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>It doesn't matter what your scale
</span><span class='line'>Nor where you got your funding
</span><span class='line'>If devs don't love their users then
</span><span class='line'>Your futures will be plunging
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>The vision that you started with
</span><span class='line'>To set the world aright?
</span><span class='line'>Must be spread to everyone
</span><span class='line'>Who gives your product life
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>The sub-creators of the world
</span><span class='line'>Must love the things they make
</span><span class='line'>If you would lead, then you're the one
</span><span class='line'>To spark their hearts awake
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>They can't be bought with snacks or drink
</span><span class='line'>And process least of all
</span><span class='line'>Can bring the flush of health into
</span><span class='line'>A coder once he fall
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>And now I fly from show to show
</span><span class='line'>Telling wide my story
</span><span class='line'>To coders young who may yet learn
</span><span class='line'>Where lies their future glory
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>The old PM, whose eye is bright,
</span><span class='line'>Whose blog with age is stale,
</span><span class='line'>Is gone; and now the Conference-Goer
</span><span class='line'>Departs the conference vale.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>He leaves like one who has been stunned,
</span><span class='line'>And is of sense forlorn:
</span><span class='line'>A sadder, wiser hacker then
</span><span class='line'>He rose the morrow morn.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>What class this is I think I know<br/>
The slides are on my laptop though<br/>
I did not look at them last night<br/>
I can’t be sure I know their flow</p>

<p>My Facebook friends must think it queer<br/>
That I am gone nine months a year<br/>
My eyes betray I did not sleep<br/>
But for this class? Affected cheer!</p>

<p>A student jolts himself awake<br/>
To ask if there is some mistake<br/>
The only other sound’s the hum<br/>
Of laptop fans before the break</p>

<p>These slides are lovely, dark and deep<br/>
But I have classes left to teach<br/>
And miles to earn before I sleep<br/>
And miles to earn before I sleep</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://2015.javazone.no/">2015 JavaZone</a> was the same amazing event it always is: world-class speakers, JavaZone&#8217;s ground-breaking <em>continuous food</em> concept, and an expo floor that&#8217;s actually fun to walk around. Like any great conference, it&#8217;s a place to learn and reconnect with friends—some whom I only get to see once a year.</p>

<p><a href="http://2015.javazone.no/journeyzone.html">JourneyZone</a>—the long weekend away someplace in Norway that JavaZone provides for its speakers after the conference—is always memorable, but this year was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. In commemoration, I present to you <em>Polar Zone 2015</em>:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wandered lonely as a cloud app<br/>
Late of Heroku purchases<br/>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br/>
A host of microservices<br/>
Beyond the build, beneath the stats<br/>
My code in chunks and bits thereat</p>

<p>Continuous was the app deployed<br/>
In all its many-splendored parts<br/>
They spread in Dockerfiles alloyed<br/>
With CoreOS hosts&#8217; very hearts<br/>
Ten thousand saw I when I looked<br/>
At Kubernetes’ dashboard hooks</p>

<p>The Mesos cluster’s web display<br/>
Showed every resource fully used<br/>
Yet the goal at start of day<br/>
Was just an app for scraping news<br/>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br/>
That wealth to me this stack had brought</p>

<p>Now oft, when at my screen I stare,<br/>
Commenting on Hacker News,<br/>
My only company, despair<br/>
And the bill from EC2,<br/>
Then filled my heart with sorrow is—<br/>
The sorrow of the services.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://blog.circleci.com/its-the-future/">Paul Biggar’s fictional dialog</a> on the same topic. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Wandered_Lonely_as_a_Cloud">the Wordsworth original</a> of which I frankly am not too fond, but for which I am grateful on the occasion of my own fooling about.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: since I have friends who work with some of the named technologies, I should make it clear that I am not down on any of them. As I have <a href="https://player.oreilly.com/videos/9781491924914">said elsewhere</a> (shameless plug!), distributed systems are bad in just about every way and should be avoided when possible. Fortunately—since I make my living in distributed systems—sometimes they are the only way to do the awesome thing you want to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had a great time at GitHub over the past year and a half. I&#8217;ve traveled to plenty of interesting places, taught thousands of developers how to do a better job working together, and learned quite a bit myself from GitHub&#8217;s unique approach to organizational structure. It&#8217;s a tautology to say that the experience has changed me, but I think time will reveal that it has changed me in important ways. Hopefully I can write about some of this in the future.</p>

<p>GitHub is a great place to work, but the landscape of one&#8217;s career is constantly shifting, and staying on top of one&#8217;s own calling requires constant adaptation and re-evaluation. Managing a career is like climbing a mountain, except it&#8217;s a mountain whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdcJLwKIoFo">elevation constantly shifts</a> in response to your own footsteps. My current path has led me, as of today, to leave GitHub for an exciting new opportunity.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be joining DataStax as their Director for Technical Enablement. I&#8217;ve known the folks at DataStax for years, and even did some contract work for them back when I was on my own. When they offered me an interesting position doing what I love, I jumped at the chance. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that they&#8217;re a classy bunch of people who seem to have figured out how to combine a startup&#8217;s pragmatism and adaptability with the structures and attitudes of a mature business.</p>

<p>Starting a week from today, I&#8217;ll be focused on helping DataStax channel partners be better at delivering Cassandra-based solutions to their customers. Apache Cassandra and DataStax Enterprise are complex products that solve difficult problems, and people need help getting that job done. I&#8217;ll be doing a lot of the same sorts of things I&#8217;ve been doing of the past few years—conference talks, classes, workshops, and videos—but focused on the indirect sales channel instead of the end user. This is a whole new world for me, and I&#8217;m really excited to jump into it. I will do my best to keep you posted here with what I learn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like a home game, so I must say I&#8217;m happy to be speaking at <a href="http://denverjug.org">DJUG</a> next week on Wednesday, October 10, 2012. The topic will be GitHub Power Tools, including such amazing topics as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pull Requests</li>
<li>Issue Tracking</li>
<li>Project Sites</li>
<li>Custom domain names</li>
<li>Team and organization access controls</li>
<li>Wikis</li>
<li>OPTIONAL BONUS: Integration with third-party services</li>
</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s like the fun never ends! I&#8217;d love to see all my Denver friends there, and join you for drinks afterward.</p>

<p>DJUG meets at the offices of <a href="http://fullcontact.com">FullContact</a> at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/vQUiV">1621 18th Street Suite 40 Denver, CO 80202</a>. Food starts at 5:30pm, and my talk at 6:00pm.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I mentioned in my <a href="http://timberglund.com/blog/2012/09/17/javazone-2012/">last post</a> that JourneyZone had a few surprises this year—which surprises should perhaps not be all that surprising, given that we were riding mountain bikes in the same part of Norway that served as the <a href="http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/c/cd/0_gps2.jpg">location for the Hoth scenes</a> in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>. (Thanks to <a href="http://blog.evilmonkeylabs.com/">Brendan McAdams</a> for that link.)</p>

<p>Whether we should have seen it coming or not, we had a great time. In fact, JourneyZone wasn&#8217;t merely JourneyZone. Witness <em>SurvivorZone 2012</em>:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>JavaZone 2012 is in the books now. I don&#8217;t mind saying I <em>love</em> that show and the city it&#8217;s in. Oslo might be an expensive place to visit, but it makes up for it by being beautiful and generally easy to get around.</p>

<p>This was my third <a href="http://jz12.java.no">JavaZone</a>, but my first as a GitHubber. I actually submitted my proposals to the show before even beginning to consider going to work for GitHub, so there was no Git to be found in my talks as originally planned. Happily, the schedule had some holes open up at the last minute, so I was able to give three talks: a brand new lightning talk on Git internals, my talk on software architecture and form entitled <em><a href="https://vimeo.com/album/2079027/video/49367407">Then Our Buildings Shape Us</a></em>, and an improvised <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/2079027/video/49444883">Advanced Git</a> talk containing some new material I have recently been testing out. The response to the latter on Twitter was especially enthusiastic, with more than a few people saying it was their favorite talk of the show. Thank you, Norway! Honestly, I love you too.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/timberglund.com/photos/2012/09/agir-beer.jpg" class="fancybox left" title="This beer was actually in Flåm, not Myrdal "><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/timberglund.com/photos/2012/09/agir-beer_m.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="This beer was actually in Flåm, not Myrdal " /></a></p>

<p>Next was JourneyZone, rechristened &#8220;SurvivorZone&#8221; for its 2012 instance. JourneyZone is a three-day weekend trip to some exotic destination in Norway that the conference offers to its speakers. This year, JourneyZone started with a 22-mile mountain bike ride across the mountains of western Norway. This is typical summer fare for active Norwegians (and does not seem at all odd to this active Coloradan), but we just happened to get caught in a nasty bit of weather on Friday afternoon. Five hours of cycling through 35-mph winds and freezing rain will <em>take the fight out of you</em>. Let&#8217;s just say I have never tasted beer as good as the beer I had in Myrdal that night, and leave it at that.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/timberglund.com/photos/2012/09/flam.jpg" class="fancybox right" title="Outside our hotel in Aurland "><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/timberglund.com/photos/2012/09/flam_m.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Outside our hotel in Aurland " /></a></p>

<p>After thawing out and resting up, we took a train to Flåm to rest for the day and tour one of Norway&#8217;s largest microbreweries. If Flåm were trying not to be beautiful, it would count as the most spectacular failure known to the sons of men.</p>

<p>When we returned home on Sunday night, I hosted the second annual GitHub Oslo Drinkup.  Oslo developers came to talk about what they were doing with Git and with technology in general, joined by not a few JavaZone speakers and staff—Git fans all.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/timberglund.com/photos/2012/09/oslo-drinkup.jpg" class="fancybox left" title="2012 The Octocat makes its appearance in Oslo "><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/timberglund.com/photos/2012/09/oslo-drinkup.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="2012 The Octocat makes its appearance in Oslo " /></a></p>

<p>Thanks to GitHub for the opportunity to evangelize our technology in places like this, to <a href="http://java.no">javaBin</a> and the JavaZone organizers for putting on such a great show. God willing, I will see you next September.</p>
