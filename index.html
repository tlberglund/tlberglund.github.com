  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started my consulting business five years ago so I could upgrade my computer more often and go to more conferences. Okay, that&#8217;s a little bit of an exaggeration; not all of my concerns were so quotidian. I had also run out of opportunities for technical growth at that company, and didn&#8217;t want to become obsolete in my mid-30s. So I went into business for myself. I named the company after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Church Father</a> of whom I happen to be a moderate fanboy.</p>

<p>I had several goals when I started. I wanted to become noteworthy, I wanted to work on cool tech, I wanted to build consequential systems, I wanted to make a lot of money, I wanted to build and mentor a team, and so on. I also wanted a new laptop every two years and to go to <a href="http://nofluffjuststuff.com">No Fluff</a> when it came to town. Was that so wrong?</p>

<p>I reached a few of those goals. I successfully bought laptops and attended No Fluff four times before I joined the tour myself. I&#8217;m as noteworthy within my circles as I need to be. I&#8217;ve established a decent reputation as a conference speaker, with the promise of additional growth in the future. I have aligned myself with some technologies I think are cool. I&#8217;ve discovered a passion to teach, which I&#8217;ve been able to pursue rather fully. I don&#8217;t build a lot of truly consequential things—at least not on a grand cultural scale—but I have done good work that has been a practical means by which I could love my neighbor and produce small islands of order in a world of chaos. And the money has been fine.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never quite succeeded in building a team, though, and this has been an impediment to me. I really like the ethos of eating only what I kill, but in reality, that ethos is economically inefficient in the extreme. Hunter-gatherers do not accumulate wealth. Worse yet, I am deeply satisfied by mentoring people, which is hard to do alone. If you will forgive me a small shift in the metaphor from the paleolithic to the neolithic: hunter-gatherers may be permanently afraid of being hungry tomorrow, but shepherds without sheep are not even shepherds.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I very rapidly came to a point where I had to decide what it is that I really care about. To what am I called? Is it entrepreneurship or is it building useful things together with other people? If my calling (to coin a Pauline phrase) is to build where no one else has laid a foundation, then I am compelled to stick it out on my own and fix the character defects that have kept me from achieving the goals I had not yet met. If, on the other hand, my calling is to build consequential things, and to shepherd other people in the process of building the same, then whether I work for a company I own or a company owned by someone else suddenly becomes unimportant. It became time for me to know whether I am essentially an engineer or an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>With that question at hand, I found myself with a generous offer of employment from quite possibly the best technology company on the planet. I had already fallen in love with their culture and the deeply humanizing way they build things and organize work internally. I am truly excited about being able to work alongside and learn from some of the best in the business. And I am definitely not above being attracted by the cachet they hold as a beloved member of the development community. An opportunity like this is a very clarifying thing, and has helped me refine my understanding of my calling. I am most certainly an entrepreneur, but only incidentally. Essentially, I am an engineer. And so I go.</p>

<p>This company doesn&#8217;t do titles and doesn&#8217;t assign you work, so I don&#8217;t really know what I&#8217;ll end up doing at the end of the day. But if I understand things correctly, my work will really only be limited to my own vision, innovation, and ability to inspire others to cooperate with me. I&#8217;m keenly aware of where my weaknesses lie as a person, but on these three counts, I should be just fine.</p>

<p>This is the part where I should say it&#8217;s been difficult to say goodbye to five years of independence and the dream of building on my own the kind of company I am joining today. But the fact is, it wasn&#8217;t really difficult at all. Once the opportunity was clear to me, it was pretty easy to figure out where I was going, what I would spend the coming years doing, and what a nontrivial portion of my identity was going to become. And today, I am happy to be able to tell you what that is.</p>

<p>As of today, I am a GitHubber.</p>
