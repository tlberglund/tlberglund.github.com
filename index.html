  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was more than a little bit jazzed a couple of weeks ago when <a href="http://datastax.com">DataStax</a> announced that I had been nominated as a <a href="http://www.datastax.com/mvp">Cassandra MVP</a> for the 2012-2013 term. I wasn&#8217;t able to be at the Cassandra Summit to receive the designation in person, but I was no less grateful for it.</p>

<p>As an MVP, I&#8217;ll be able to participate in the occasional Cassandra webinar, blog in an official capacity, talk to press like a boss, and generally just enjoy an enhanced reputation in the world of the best scalable non-relational datastore on the planet. Best of all, I&#8217;ll continue to speak on Cassandra when I&#8217;m able. Be sure to look for me to talk about what my new employer, <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, is doing in this space.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one thing for DataStax to recognize members of the C* community who have contributed to its success, but it&#8217;s another thing entirely for them to shower generous gifts on them. When I got home early on Saturday morning from a week away, I was delighted to find that they had send me tee shirts, an <a href="http://instagram.com/p/OiSktSvAoj/">awesome pint glass</a> (pictured with homebrew), and <em>a new iPad</em>! Thanks, DataStax. This was truly a classy gift for a guy who loves you and your product.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I wrote <a href="http://www.augusttechgroup.com/tim/blog/2011/05/12/oh-the-methods-youll-compose/">Oh, The Methods You&#8217;ll Compose</a> last year, I started casting about for what I&#8217;d do next.  I had just finished writing <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920019909.do">Building and Testing With Gradle</a> with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewatambientideas">Matthew</a>, so JVM build tools were on my mind (and in the case of <a href="http://gradle.org">Gradle</a>, they still are). Standing in my kitchen one spring day, not thinking about anything in particular, it hit me that <em>Maven</em> rhymes with <em>Raven</em>. The rest is, of course, history.</p>

<p>A long and interesting history, as it turns out. One filled with glued-on muttonchops, an awesome sister who knows far too much about period costumes and has more 19th-century-looking artifacts lying around her house than ought to be allowed, and a son who shows no small amount of promise as a composer. It is therefore with great pride that I present to you <em>The Maven</em>:</p>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
</span><span class='line'>Over files from a project which I'd never built before,
</span><span class='line'>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly the build was crapping,
</span><span class='line'>As if some build script's code was jacking, jacking up my source code store
</span><span class='line'>"'Tis a little bug," I muttered, "crapping on my source code store—
</span><span class='line'>Only this, and nothing more."
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Ah, distinctly I remember I was just a junior member,
</span><span class='line'>Of a staff who counted building code as something to ignore
</span><span class='line'>An open-source solution neatly I had sought to use completely
</span><span class='line'>In vain hope that I deplete the problems in my source code store—
</span><span class='line'>To fix the troubled build that kept a hold on my poor source code store—
</span><span class='line'>My broken build, for evermore.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>And the sullen sad surrender of my servers to the end of
</span><span class='line'>Days when code would build had lent me terrors never felt before
</span><span class='line'>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
</span><span class='line'>"'Tis some little bug entreating entrance to my source code store—
</span><span class='line'>Some little bug entreating entrance to my source code store—
</span><span class='line'>Only this, and nothing more,"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Presently I took to guessing how my build script might be messing
</span><span class='line'>Messing up the build I thought should work as in the days of yore
</span><span class='line'>But the fact is I was coding, not counting on the foul foreboding
</span><span class='line'>Of a Tool now overgrowing the bound'ries of its building chore
</span><span class='line'>It made its mark upon my code beyond its humble building chore
</span><span class='line'>It owned my build, still wanting more
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Deep into the POM file peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
</span><span class='line'>Doubting, dreaming dreams no coder ever dared to dream before;
</span><span class='line'>But the silence was unbroken (the error message gave no token),
</span><span class='line'>And my greatest fear unspoken was if again I'd have control
</span><span class='line'>Could I again believe myself to be the one who had control?
</span><span class='line'>To own my build, and nothing more?
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Back unto my laptop turning, all my soul within me burning,
</span><span class='line'>Soon again the build was crapping somewhat harder than before.
</span><span class='line'>"Surely," said I, "surely that is what happens when a depend'ncy graph is
</span><span class='line'>Stretched until the length of path is b’yond what man has seen before
</span><span class='line'>Let me see what jars are needed, and their dependencies explore—
</span><span class='line'>'Tis just the jars and nothing more!
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>"Now adopted as our standard to build each project I commanded
</span><span class='line'>Maven be the tool that we would use to ease our building chore
</span><span class='line'>Straight away it took to forcing us to follow, not endorsing
</span><span class='line'>Its coerc’d opinions now divorcing sense from all my source code store
</span><span class='line'>It took control of every build inside my troubled source code store
</span><span class='line'>I built with Maven, evermore
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>From the enterprise beguiling this tool my fancy into smiling,
</span><span class='line'>By the standard settings and conventions rigid that it bore,
</span><span class='line'>"Though thy brackets angled, Maven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven.
</span><span class='line'>Mayhap you'd ease the maintenance of my builds and their Sis'phean chore
</span><span class='line'>Tell me, can you ease the burden of my Sisyphean chore?"
</span><span class='line'>Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Much I marveled this ungainly tool to hear discourse so plainly,
</span><span class='line'>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
</span><span class='line'>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
</span><span class='line'>Ever yet was blessed with speaking tools within his source code store—
</span><span class='line'>Tool or script within the central repo of his source code store,
</span><span class='line'>With such name as "Nevermore."
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>But the Maven chosen boldly as our standard now spoke only
</span><span class='line'>That one word, as if its soul in that one word it did outpour.
</span><span class='line'>No more meaning then it printed—though its output scrolled and dinted—
</span><span class='line'>Till I scarcely more than hinted "Other builds I've built before;
</span><span class='line'>On the morrow it will leave me, as my builds have failed before."
</span><span class='line'>Then the tool said, "Nevermore."
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
</span><span class='line'>"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
</span><span class='line'>Written by a tortured coder whose melancholy's only token
</span><span class='line'>Left both code and coder broken till his tool one burden bore—
</span><span class='line'>Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
</span><span class='line'>Of 'Never-nevermore.'
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>"But the Maven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
</span><span class='line'>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of build and editor;
</span><span class='line'>Then, upon the vinyl sinking, I betook myself to linking
</span><span class='line'>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous tool of yore—
</span><span class='line'>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous tool of yore
</span><span class='line'>Meant in croaking "Nevermore."
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
</span><span class='line'>To the tool whose fiery eyes now burned into my coder's core;
</span><span class='line'>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
</span><span class='line'>On the Aeron's vinyl lining which the backlight gloated o'er,
</span><span class='line'>But whose charcoal vinyl lining which the backlight gloated o'er,
</span><span class='line'>My code shall see, ah, nevermore!
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by an unseen censer
</span><span class='line'>And dependencies whose downloads glut my cache, and even more.
</span><span class='line'>"Wretch!" I cried, "VanZyl hath lent you—by these downloads he has sent you
</span><span class='line'>Respite, respite! and some Red Bull from my cursed source code store
</span><span class='line'>Quaff, oh quaff this can of Red Bull, and forget this source code store!"
</span><span class='line'>Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, build tool or devil!
</span><span class='line'>Whether useful tool, or whether bane of every coder on this floor
</span><span class='line'>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this code base yet enchanted—
</span><span class='line'>On this build by horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
</span><span class='line'>Is there a tool that would not own me? Tell me, tell me, I implore!"
</span><span class='line'>Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! Prophet still, build tool or devil!
</span><span class='line'>By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
</span><span class='line'>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, by building with the Maven,
</span><span class='line'>Shall I never make the claim that I retain just some control?
</span><span class='line'>Could some little token of my build remain in my control?"
</span><span class='line'>Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>"Be that word our sign of parting, building fiend!" I shrieked upstarting—
</span><span class='line'>"Get thee back to Sonatype deep in the night's Plutonian shore!
</span><span class='line'>Leave no jar file as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
</span><span class='line'>Leave my project's build unbroken!—quit my central source code store!
</span><span class='line'>Take thy POM from out my heart, and take thy cache from my code store!
</span><span class='line'>"Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>And the Maven, never quitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
</span><span class='line'>In that pallid project's repo deep inside my source code store;
</span><span class='line'>Its POM files' eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
</span><span class='line'>And the backlight o'er me streaming throws my shadow on the floor;
</span><span class='line'>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
</span><span class='line'>Shall be lifted—nevermore!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started my consulting business five years ago so I could upgrade my computer more often and go to more conferences. Okay, that&#8217;s a little bit of an exaggeration; not all of my concerns were so quotidian. I had also run out of opportunities for technical growth at that company, and didn&#8217;t want to become obsolete in my mid-30s. So I went into business for myself. I named the company after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Church Father</a> of whom I happen to be a moderate fanboy.</p>

<p>I had several goals when I started. I wanted to become noteworthy, I wanted to work on cool tech, I wanted to build consequential systems, I wanted to make a lot of money, I wanted to build and mentor a team, and so on. I also wanted a new laptop every two years and to go to <a href="http://nofluffjuststuff.com">No Fluff</a> when it came to town. Was that so wrong?</p>

<p>I reached a few of those goals. I successfully bought laptops and attended No Fluff four times before I joined the tour myself. I&#8217;m as noteworthy within my circles as I need to be. I&#8217;ve established a decent reputation as a conference speaker, with the promise of additional growth in the future. I have aligned myself with some technologies I think are cool. I&#8217;ve discovered a passion to teach, which I&#8217;ve been able to pursue rather fully. I don&#8217;t build a lot of truly consequential things—at least not on a grand cultural scale—but I have done good work that has been a practical means by which I could love my neighbor and produce small islands of order in a world of chaos. And the money has been fine.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never quite succeeded in building a team, though, and this has been an impediment to me. I really like the ethos of eating only what I kill, but in reality, that ethos is economically inefficient in the extreme. Hunter-gatherers do not accumulate wealth. Worse yet, I am deeply satisfied by mentoring people, which is hard to do alone. If you will forgive me a small shift in the metaphor from the paleolithic to the neolithic: hunter-gatherers may be permanently afraid of being hungry tomorrow, but shepherds without sheep are not even shepherds.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I very rapidly came to a point where I had to decide what it is that I really care about. To what am I called? Is it entrepreneurship or is it building useful things together with other people? If my calling (to coin a Pauline phrase) is to build where no one else has laid a foundation, then I am compelled to stick it out on my own and fix the character defects that have kept me from achieving the goals I had not yet met. If, on the other hand, my calling is to build consequential things, and to shepherd other people in the process of building the same, then whether I work for a company I own or a company owned by someone else suddenly becomes unimportant. It became time for me to know whether I am essentially an engineer or an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>With that question at hand, I found myself with a generous offer of employment from quite possibly the best technology company on the planet. I had already fallen in love with their culture and the deeply humanizing way they build things and organize work internally. I am truly excited about being able to work alongside and learn from some of the best in the business. And I am definitely not above being attracted by the cachet they hold as a beloved member of the development community. An opportunity like this is a very clarifying thing, and has helped me refine my understanding of my calling. I am most certainly an entrepreneur, but only incidentally. Essentially, I am an engineer. And so I go.</p>

<p>This company doesn&#8217;t do titles and doesn&#8217;t assign you work, so I don&#8217;t really know what I&#8217;ll end up doing at the end of the day. But if I understand things correctly, my work will really only be limited to my own vision, innovation, and ability to inspire others to cooperate with me. I&#8217;m keenly aware of where my weaknesses lie as a person, but on these three counts, I should be just fine.</p>

<p>This is the part where I should say it&#8217;s been difficult to say goodbye to five years of independence and the dream of building on my own the kind of company I am joining today. But the fact is, it wasn&#8217;t really difficult at all. Once the opportunity was clear to me, it was pretty easy to figure out where I was going, what I would spend the coming years doing, and what a nontrivial portion of my identity was going to become. And today, I am happy to be able to tell you what that is.</p>

<p>As of today, I am a GitHubber.</p>
